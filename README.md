## About This Project

This project is a portfolio designed to showcase my skills and projects. It is built with Next.js.

In this portfolio, you will find:

- A section about me
- A list of my projects
- A blog section with various articles, including the story of my career change
- A contact form

ðŸ‘‰ Feel free to explore and contact me if you have any questions or comments.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
